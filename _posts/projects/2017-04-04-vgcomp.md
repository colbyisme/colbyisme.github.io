<p>At the University of Delaware, I teamed up with one of the computer science professors for an NES game jam written from scratch in 6502 assembly. I created the score of his request: an arrangement of the Jazz Emu song, "Still Waiting" (which shared name with this game). While small in scope, this was a fulfilling experience, providing an intersection of my musical skills with my computer science studies. Client was happy. &#128512;</p>

Funny enough, I also did the exact opposite by creating a band arrangement of the song "V.S. Lancer" from Toby Fox's Deltarune. I play all the guitar parts and many of the synths.

I am currently looking to build a portfolio of video game composition work and am willing to commit to any projects.
