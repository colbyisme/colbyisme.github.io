<p>Besides Local Orange, I've provided bass, drum, percussion, and electric guitar performances for other local bands and groups, both live and in the studio, thriving in a team-based environment. I've also aided other bands in songwriting. Take for instance the video on the side of the song "Knock on Wood" by Annapolis band Trees Moma, one of the bands I perform with live, and a song I co-wrote.</p>
