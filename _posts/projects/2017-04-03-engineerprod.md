<p>I've helped record other bands along with my own music. I am proficient in a variety of digital audio workstations (DAWs), from contemporary standards like Pro Tools and Logic Pro to more archaic tools such as tracker software. I also have a strong understanding of basic and advanced audio processing tools (compression, EQ, routing, etc.), and engineering techniques (microphones and mic placement, phase, etc.) I have experience recording vocals, drums, bass, guitar, syntheziers, and saxophone. </p>

<p>
I started honing my ear for audio production during my last 2 years of high school as the primary music technician, responsible for micing up actors and ensuring the highest fidelity sound in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. I was also a live DJ on WVUD at the University of Delaware, and am currently a member of WMBC at UMBC.</p>
