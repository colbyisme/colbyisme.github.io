<p>Most of my musical ventures are through the lens of "Local Orange", a post-punk/indie rock band heavily influenced by the palettes of progressive rock and jazz-fusion-tinged video game soundtracks. From concept to circulation, I have a hand in every step of the music process. While I sing and play guitar live, All songs are written and originally performed by me, as well as engineered and produced by a small team comprising of me, other band members, and other close contacts. I'm grateful to make music with some of my best friends who just so happen to be musicians I hold in such high regard. I have even shared the stage with some of the biggest musicians and artists ever, notably Filter, Collective Soul, and Live.</p>
