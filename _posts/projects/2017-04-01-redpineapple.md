<p>Most of my musical ventures are through the lens of "Local Orange", a post-punk/indie rock band heavily influenced by the palettes of progressive rock and jazz-fusion-tinged video game soundtracks. From concept to circulation, I have a hand in every step of the music process. All songs are written and originally performed by me, as well as engineered and produced by a small team comprising of me, other band members, and other close contacts. I've shared the stage with famous musicians and artists, notably Filter, Collective Soul, and Live.
